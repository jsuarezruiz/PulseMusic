# Pulse Music

Pulse Music is a Xamarin.Forms sample to show how to create **goodlooking UI** with Xamarin.Forms. This sample is based on [Music Player App](https://dribbble.com/shots/1939991-Music-Player-App-WIP) designed by [Anish Chandran](https://dribbble.com/anish_chandran).

***NOTES**:The icons of the App are not exactly the same. Used similar icons taken from [Metro Studio](https://www.syncfusion.com/downloads/metrostudio).* 

*The main objective of the sample is to show the creation of the Player's UI (circular progress, rotating cover, etc.). This App is NOT a real player.*
